Fix the code in the code tab to pass this challenge (only syntax errors). 
Look at the examples below to get an idea of what the function should do.

function cubes(a) {
	retunr a ** 3
}

//-- FOR TESTING --//
cubes(3) ➞ 27

cubes(5) ➞ 125

cubes(10) ➞ 1000

NOTES:
    READ EVERY WORD CAREFULLY, CHARACTER BY CHARACTER!

const cubes = (a) => a ** 3


console.log(cubes(3)) // 27
console.log(cubes(5)) // 125
console.log(cubes(10)) // 1000
